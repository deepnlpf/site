title: API REST
---

DeepNLPF has a HTTP RESTful that allows you to use its services through POS, GET, PUT and DELETE requests. This makes it possible for applications running on low performance computers to take advantage of this technology, leaving the processing overhead to the server.

## Start Service
The following command is required to start the service.

    $ deepnlpf --api start

By accessing the address: ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/``` you will see a screen like this informing you that the API has been successfully started and is ready to use.
