## Repositories

Here you will find all external tool plugins built by us and third parties to use on deepnlpf.

A plugin is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program. When a program supports plug-ins, it allows customization.

There are many benefits to building apps with a plugin framework:

- 3rd party developers can create and extend upon your app.
- New features are easier to developer.
- Your application becomes smaller and easier to understand.

## Plugin Architecture

The DeepNLPF can run registered plugins. The plugins will need to meet the specifications defined by our framework in order to run.
